	* Knowing is a good start, but practicing + applying knowledge is the real challenge

## Measure your Baseline Happiness

Your first "assignment" is to measure your current level of happiness using one or two validated psychological surveys. These scores will serve as a “baseline” of your happiness level at the start of this experience. At the end of the course, you’ll redo the survey to see if your happiness and overall mood have changed after doing these positive practices for several weeks.

PERMA (an acronym for Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment— the basic dimensions of psychological flourishing). The questionnaire is 23 questions and once you submit your responses, you will receive scores ranging from 0-10 for each pillar along with scores for overall well-being, health, and negative emotions.

Positive emotions = 6.67 
Engagement = 7.67 
Relationships = 7 
Meaning = 8 
Accomplishment = 8
Health = 6.67 
Negative emotions = 6.67 
Loneliness = 6 
Overall Well-Being = 7.38

The Authentic Happiness Inventory is a validated, 24-question survey that measures overall well-being. At the end of the survey, you will receive a score between 1-5.

Your Authentic Happiness Score is:  2.54
